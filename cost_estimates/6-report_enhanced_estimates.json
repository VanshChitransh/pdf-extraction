Gov Report Identification: 081625AD1, 18559 Denise Dale Ln, Houston, TX I=Inspected NI=Not Inspected NP=Not Present D=Deficient I NI NP D Note For Buyer: A roof is composed of various systems and layers that work together to prevent water from entering the structure. These systems include the roof covering, underlayment, metal flashing, sheathing, and rafters. During a home inspection, the roof is inspected visually, focusing on accessible areas. However, many parts of the roof are not visible, so the inspection may not identify all potential damage, installation defects, or leaks. If there are concerns about the roof's condition, such as leaksor visible wear, it is recommended to consult a qualified roofing professional. They can provide a more thorough assessment, including the roof's insurability, life expectancy, and potential for future problems. F 535.228 (c) (2): The inspector is not required to determine (i) the remaining life expectancy of the roof; or (ii) the number of layers of roof covering material. ROOF PENETRATIONS / EVIDENCE OF ACTIVE ROOF PENETRATION: Areas of water stained/ rotted roof decking observed in attic. All accessible stains were checked with moisture meter, no active moisture detected at time of inspection. Roof skylight(s) are a likely place for water penetration, make sure flashing and glass edges are maintained.

EVIDENCE OF WATER PENETRATION: None observed at the time of inspection. THERMAL IMAGING: No significant deficienciesor anomalies observed at the time of inspection. F This inspection consisted of using a FLIRor similar infrared camera and walking the interior of the property looking for anomalies that would warrant further investigation using a pin type moisture meter and areas of deficient insulation. Be advised that a thermal scan is not a substitute for indoor air quality testing (IAQ), testing for pollutants and other bio-hazards. If client is concerned about the quality of indoor airor presence of bio-hazardsor pollutants, a qualified IAQ specialist should be consulted. \u00fe \u0308 \u0308 \u00fe.",

Gov Report Identification: 081625AD1, 18559 Denise Dale Ln, Houston, TX I=Inspected NI=Not Inspected NP=Not Present D=Deficient I NI NP D Note For Buyer: A roof is composed of various systems and layers that work together to prevent water from entering the structure. These systems include the roof covering, underlayment, metal flashing, sheathing, and rafters. During a home inspection, the roof is inspected visually, focusing on accessible areas. However, many parts of the roof are not visible, so the inspection may not identify all potential damage, installation defects, or leaks. If there are concerns about the roof's condition, such as leaksor visible wear, it is recommended to consult a qualified roofing professional. They can provide a more thorough assessment, including the roof's insurability, life expectancy, and potential for future problems. F 535.228 (c) (2): The inspector is not required to determine (i) the remaining life expectancy of the roof; or (ii) the number of layers of roof covering material. ROOF PENETRATIONS / EVIDENCE OF ACTIVE ROOF PENETRATION: Areas of water stained/ rotted roof decking observed in attic.

Caulking missing and/or deficient around windows / vertical trim / joints in siding. May allow wind driven rain entry. Observed cracks in exterior wall structure at time of inspection. Cracks occur from expansion and contraction of building materials, brick ties that have come lose from rust, settlement of foundation, defects in brick veneeror foundation cracking. Hairline cracksor a common occurrence usually seen in mortar joints. Cracks that appear through brick veneer walls that are 1/8\u201d in width could be a sign that the foundation movement is beyond normal settlement.

Gov Report Identification: 081625AD1, 18559 Denise Dale Ln, Houston, TX I=Inspected NI=Not Inspected NP=Not Present D=Deficient I NI NP D Note For Buyer: A roof is composed of various systems and layers that work together to prevent water from entering the structure. These systems include the roof covering, underlayment, metal flashing, sheathing, and rafters. During a home inspection, the roof is inspected visually, focusing on accessible areas. However, many parts of the roof are not visible, so the inspection may not identify all potential damage, installation defects, or leaks. If there are concerns about the roof's condition, such as leaksor visible wear, it is recommended to consult a qualified roofing professional. They can provide a more thorough assessment, including the roof's insurability, life expectancy, and potential for future problems. F 535.228 (c) (2): The inspector is not required to determine (i) the remaining life expectancy of the roof; or (ii) the number of layers of roof covering material. ROOF PENETRATIONS / EVIDENCE OF ACTIVE ROOF PENETRATION: Areas of water stained/ rotted roof decking observed in attic. All accessible stains were checked with moisture meter, no active moisture detected at time of inspection. Roof skylight(s) are a likely place for water penetration, make sure flashing and glass edges are maintained.

During the inspection, some registers showed visible dirt and possible microbial growth, indicating a buildup of debris within the system. While no major damage was noted, aging ductwork can develop air leaks, insulation breakdown, and reduced efficiency over time. Recommended to have the ductwork professionally cleaned to address the observed debris and potential microbial contaminants. In addition, a licensed HVAC contractor should evaluate the overall condition of the duct system to determine if any sealing, repairs, or full replacement is needed to improve air quality and system performance. F Client Advisory: This company does not inspect the interior of the HVAC Duct System. We do not inspect for, and are not qualified to render opinions on, any type of environmentalor other bio-hazards.

It is my opinion that the overall degree of the existing foundation movement for this structure is moderate, and is acceptable for a house of this age and type construction. The foundation is, in our opinion, functional and is not in need of releveling. A foundation elevation survey was conducted during the inspection. The table below represents data gathered using a Zip Level and adjusting for floor covering height differences. Honeycombing in the foundation observed at oneor more locations. Observed oneor more small cracks in the foundation. Large tree(s) near the house foundation. This condition can have adverse effects on foundation performance. If this is a concern, recommend consideration of installing a root barrieror other preventative measures.

Gov Report Identification: 081625AD1, 18559 Denise Dale Ln, Houston, TX I=Inspected NI=Not Inspected NP=Not Present D=Deficient I NI NP D SUGGESTED FOUNDATION MAINTENANCE & CARE - Proper drainage and moisture maintenance to all types of foundations due to the expansive nature of the area load bearing soils. Drainage must be directed away from all sides of the foundation with grade slopes. Foundations support a house by distributing its weight to the ground. The two common types are concrete slabs and pier-and-beam foundations. Any movement in the foundation can affect the house's structure. During a home inspection, inspectors look at the visible parts of the foundation, inside and outside the house, for cracks, uneven floors, or other signs of problems. However, many parts of the foundation can't be seen because they're hidden by walls, floors, landscaping, or other things. Inspectors usually don't use special toolsor take measurements to find out the exact condition of the foundation. They rely on what they can see. If any issues, like cracksor uneven areas, are noticed, it's recommended to have a qualified foundation specialist conduct a further evaluation. These issues may indicate more serious problems, so a thorough assessment and diagnosis by a qualified professional are advised. \u00fe \u0308 \u0308 \u00fe.",

It is my opinion that the overall degree of the existing foundation movement for this structure is moderate, and is acceptable for a house of this age and type construction. The foundation is, in our opinion, functional and is not in need of releveling. A foundation elevation survey was conducted during the inspection. The table below represents data gathered using a Zip Level and adjusting for floor covering height differences. Honeycombing in the foundation observed at oneor more locations. Observed oneor more small cracks in the foundation. Large tree(s) near the house foundation. This condition can have adverse effects on foundation performance. If this is a concern, recommend consideration of installing a root barrieror other preventative measures.

Gov Report Identification: 081625AD1, 18559 Denise Dale Ln, Houston, TX I=Inspected NI=Not Inspected NP=Not Present D=Deficient I NI NP D SUGGESTED FOUNDATION MAINTENANCE & CARE - Proper drainage and moisture maintenance to all types of foundations due to the expansive nature of the area load bearing soils. Drainage must be directed away from all sides of the foundation with grade slopes. Foundations support a house by distributing its weight to the ground. The two common types are concrete slabs and pier-and-beam foundations. Any movement in the foundation can affect the house's structure. During a home inspection, inspectors look at the visible parts of the foundation, inside and outside the house, for cracks, uneven floors, or other signs of problems. However, many parts of the foundation can't be seen because they're hidden by walls, floors, landscaping, or other things. Inspectors usually don't use special toolsor take measurements to find out the exact condition of the foundation. They rely on what they can see. If any issues, like cracksor uneven areas, are noticed, it's recommended to have a qualified foundation specialist conduct a further evaluation. These issues may indicate more serious problems, so a thorough assessment and diagnosis by a qualified professional are advised. \u00fe \u0308 \u0308 \u00fe.",

These systems include the roof covering, underlayment, metal flashing, sheathing, and rafters. During a home inspection, the roof is inspected visually, focusing on accessible areas. However, many parts of the roof are not visible, so the inspection may not identify all potential damage, installation defects, or leaks. If there are concerns about the roof's condition, such as leaksor visible wear, it is recommended to consult a qualified roofing professional. They can provide a more thorough assessment, including the roof's insurability, life expectancy, and potential for future problems. F 535.228 (c) (2): The inspector is not required to determine (i) the remaining life expectancy of the roof; or (ii) the number of layers of roof covering material. ROOF PENETRATIONS / EVIDENCE OF ACTIVE ROOF PENETRATION: Areas of water stained/ rotted roof decking observed in attic. All accessible stains were checked with moisture meter, no active moisture detected at time of inspection. Roof skylight(s) are a likely place for water penetration, make sure flashing and glass edges are maintained.

A growing concern to date includes the adverse effect on indoor air quality and the potential for inherent health hazards. If concerned the client is advised to contact a qualified Professional for further evaluations of this. EXTERIOR: Need sealing/caulking around all holes and exterior siding penetrations. Caulking missing and/or deficient around windows / vertical trim / joints in siding. May allow wind driven rain entry. Observed cracks in exterior wall structure at time of inspection. Cracks occur from expansion and contraction of building materials, brick ties that have come lose from rust, settlement of foundation, defects in brick veneeror foundation cracking. Hairline cracksor a common occurrence usually seen in mortar joints. Cracks that appear through brick veneer walls that are 1/8\u201d in width could be a sign that the foundation movement is beyond normal settlement.

During the inspection, some registers showed visible dirt and possible microbial growth, indicating a buildup of debris within the system. While no major damage was noted, aging ductwork can develop air leaks, insulation breakdown, and reduced efficiency over time. Recommended to have the ductwork professionally cleaned to address the observed debris and potential microbial contaminants. In addition, a licensed HVAC contractor should evaluate the overall condition of the duct system to determine if any sealing, repairs, or full replacement is needed to improve air quality and system performance.

It is my opinion that the overall degree of the existing foundation movement for this structure is moderate, and is acceptable for a house of this age and type construction. The foundation is, in our opinion, functional and is not in need of releveling. A foundation elevation survey was conducted during the inspection. The table below represents data gathered using a Zip Level and adjusting for floor covering height differences. Honeycombing in the foundation observed at oneor more locations. Observed oneor more small cracks in the foundation. Large tree(s) near the house foundation. This condition can have adverse effects on foundation performance. If this is a concern, recommend consideration of installing a root barrieror other preventative measures.

Gov Report Identification: 081625AD1, 18559 Denise Dale Ln, Houston, TX I=Inspected NI=Not Inspected NP=Not Present D=Deficient I NI NP D SUGGESTED FOUNDATION MAINTENANCE & CARE - Proper drainage and moisture maintenance to all types of foundations due to the expansive nature of the area load bearing soils. Drainage must be directed away from all sides of the foundation with grade slopes. Foundations support a house by distributing its weight to the ground. The two common types are concrete slabs and pier-and-beam foundations. Any movement in the foundation can affect the house's structure. During a home inspection, inspectors look at the visible parts of the foundation, inside and outside the house, for cracks, uneven floors, or other signs of problems. However, many parts of the foundation can't be seen because they're hidden by walls, floors, landscaping, or other things. Inspectors usually don't use special toolsor take measurements to find out the exact condition of the foundation. They rely on what they can see. If any issues, like cracksor uneven areas, are noticed, it's recommended to have a qualified foundation specialist conduct a further evaluation. These issues may indicate more serious problems, so a thorough assessment and diagnosis by a qualified professional are advised. \u00fe \u0308 \u0308 \u00fe.",

These systems include the roof covering, underlayment, metal flashing, sheathing, and rafters. During a home inspection, the roof is inspected visually, focusing on accessible areas. However, many parts of the roof are not visible, so the inspection may not identify all potential damage, installation defects, or leaks. If there are concerns about the roof's condition, such as leaksor visible wear, it is recommended to consult a qualified roofing professional. They can provide a more thorough assessment, including the roof's insurability, life expectancy, and potential for future problems. F 535.228 (c) (2): The inspector is not required to determine (i) the remaining life expectancy of the roof; or (ii) the number of layers of roof covering material. ROOF PENETRATIONS / EVIDENCE OF ACTIVE ROOF PENETRATION: Areas of water stained/ rotted roof decking observed in attic. All accessible stains were checked with moisture meter, no active moisture detected at time of inspection. Roof skylight(s) are a likely place for water penetration, make sure flashing and glass edges are maintained.

During the inspection, some registers showed visible dirt and possible microbial growth, indicating a buildup of debris within the system. While no major damage was noted, aging ductwork can develop air leaks, insulation breakdown, and reduced efficiency over time. Recommended to have the ductwork professionally cleaned to address the observed debris and potential microbial contaminants. In addition, a licensed HVAC contractor should evaluate the overall condition of the duct system to determine if any sealing, repairs, or full replacement is needed to improve air quality and system performance.

It is my opinion that the overall degree of the existing foundation movement for this structure is moderate, and is acceptable for a house of this age and type construction. The foundation is, in our opinion, functional and is not in need of releveling. A foundation elevation survey was conducted during the inspection. The table below represents data gathered using a Zip Level and adjusting for floor covering height differences. Honeycombing in the foundation observed at oneor more locations. Observed oneor more small cracks in the foundation. Large tree(s) near the house foundation. This condition can have adverse effects on foundation performance. If this is a concern, recommend consideration of installing a root barrieror other preventative measures.

Gov Report Identification: 081625AD1, 18559 Denise Dale Ln, Houston, TX I=Inspected NI=Not Inspected NP=Not Present D=Deficient I NI NP D SUGGESTED FOUNDATION MAINTENANCE & CARE - Proper drainage and moisture maintenance to all types of foundations due to the expansive nature of the area load bearing soils. Drainage must be directed away from all sides of the foundation with grade slopes. Foundations support a house by distributing its weight to the ground. The two common types are concrete slabs and pier-and-beam foundations. Any movement in the foundation can affect the house's structure. During a home inspection, inspectors look at the visible parts of the foundation, inside and outside the house, for cracks, uneven floors, or other signs of problems. However, many parts of the foundation can't be seen because they're hidden by walls, floors, landscaping, or other things. Inspectors usually don't use special toolsor take measurements to find out the exact condition of the foundation. They rely on what they can see. If any issues, like cracksor uneven areas, are noticed, it's recommended to have a qualified foundation specialist conduct a further evaluation. These issues may indicate more serious problems, so a thorough assessment and diagnosis by a qualified professional are advised. \u00fe \u0308 \u0308 \u00fe.",

It is my opinion that the overall degree of the existing foundation movement for this structure is moderate, and is acceptable for a house of this age and type construction. The foundation is, in our opinion, functional and is not in need of releveling. A foundation elevation survey was conducted during the inspection. The table below represents data gathered using a Zip Level and adjusting for floor covering height differences. Honeycombing in the foundation observed at oneor more locations. Observed oneor more small cracks in the foundation. Large tree(s) near the house foundation. This condition can have adverse effects on foundation performance. If this is a concern, recommend consideration of installing a root barrieror other preventative measures.

Gov Report Identification: 081625AD1, 18559 Denise Dale Ln, Houston, TX I=Inspected NI=Not Inspected NP=Not Present D=Deficient I NI NP D SUGGESTED FOUNDATION MAINTENANCE & CARE - Proper drainage and moisture maintenance to all types of foundations due to the expansive nature of the area load bearing soils. Drainage must be directed away from all sides of the foundation with grade slopes. Foundations support a house by distributing its weight to the ground. The two common types are concrete slabs and pier-and-beam foundations. Any movement in the foundation can affect the house's structure. During a home inspection, inspectors look at the visible parts of the foundation, inside and outside the house, for cracks, uneven floors, or other signs of problems. However, many parts of the foundation can't be seen because they're hidden by walls, floors, landscaping, or other things. Inspectors usually don't use special toolsor take measurements to find out the exact condition of the foundation. They rely on what they can see. If any issues, like cracksor uneven areas, are noticed, it's recommended to have a qualified foundation specialist conduct a further evaluation. These issues may indicate more serious problems, so a thorough assessment and diagnosis by a qualified professional are advised. \u00fe \u0308 \u0308 \u00fe.",

Gov Report Identification: 081625AD1, 18559 Denise Dale Ln, Houston, TX I=Inspected NI=Not Inspected NP=Not Present D=Deficient I NI NP D Note For Buyer: A roof is composed of various systems and layers that work together to prevent water from entering the structure. These systems include the roof covering, underlayment, metal flashing, sheathing, and rafters. During a home inspection, the roof is inspected visually, focusing on accessible areas. However, many parts of the roof are not visible, so the inspection may not identify all potential damage, installation defects, or leaks. If there are concerns about the roof's condition, such as leaksor visible wear, it is recommended to consult a qualified roofing professional. They can provide a more thorough assessment, including the roof's insurability, life expectancy, and potential for future problems. F 535.228 (c) (2): The inspector is not required to determine (i) the remaining life expectancy of the roof; or (ii) the number of layers of roof covering material. ROOF PENETRATIONS / EVIDENCE OF ACTIVE ROOF PENETRATION: Areas of water stained/ rotted roof decking observed in attic. All accessible stains were checked with moisture meter, no active moisture detected at time of inspection. Roof skylight(s) are a likely place for water penetration, make sure flashing and glass edges are maintained.

A growing concern to date includes the adverse effect on indoor air quality and the potential for inherent health hazards. If concerned the client is advised to contact a qualified Professional for further evaluations of this. EXTERIOR: Need sealing/caulking around all holes and exterior siding penetrations. Caulking missing and/or deficient around windows / vertical trim / joints in siding. May allow wind driven rain entry. Observed cracks in exterior wall structure at time of inspection. Cracks occur from expansion and contraction of building materials, brick ties that have come lose from rust, settlement of foundation, defects in brick veneeror foundation cracking. Hairline cracksor a common occurrence usually seen in mortar joints. Cracks that appear through brick veneer walls that are 1/8\u201d in width could be a sign that the foundation movement is beyond normal settlement.

F Our inspection of the Chimney and Fireplace area(s) in accordance with the standards of practice for inspecting residential properties that includes a visual observation of all accessible components. Our inspection of them conforms to industry standards and is that of a generalist and not a specialist. While some areas of the chimney flue cannot be adequately viewed during a home inspection and does not include the use of specialized equipment, we will not guarantee their integrityor drafting ability and recommend that they be more thoroughly evaluated before the close of escrow. All chimneys and fireplace flues should be checked annually by a qualified licensed chimney specialist, and cleaned if necessary. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recommends what is known as a Level II inspection, including a video scan, by a qualified chimney specialist as part of the home buying process. A Level II inspection may identify problems that exist which cannot be detected during a general home inspection. This report is to inform the client of current condition as observed at time of the inspection.

During the inspection, some registers showed visible dirt and possible microbial growth, indicating a buildup of debris within the system. While no major damage was noted, aging ductwork can develop air leaks, insulation breakdown, and reduced efficiency over time. Recommended to have the ductwork professionally cleaned to address the observed debris and potential microbial contaminants. In addition, a licensed HVAC contractor should evaluate the overall condition of the duct system to determine if any sealing, repairs, or full replacement is needed to improve air quality and system performance. F Client Advisory: This company does not inspect the interior of the HVAC Duct System. We do not inspect for, and are not qualified to render opinions on, any type of environmentalor other bio-hazards. If this is a concernor potential concern, Inspector recommends contacting a qualified professional of your choice for further information / investigation.
