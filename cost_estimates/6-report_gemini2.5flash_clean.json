Corrugated Stainless Steel Tubing(CSST) which is a similar material as Gas Appliance Connectors (GAC's), has been linked to fires caused from direct and indirect / close proximity lightning strikes. The lightning strikes have been linked to punctures / holes in the thin stainless steel tubing and igniting fires.

This is for initial assessment and minor, immediate intervention if a small issue is found.\n\nHigh estimate ($15,300): Assumes the inspection reveals the roof is at end-of-life or has significant damage requiring full replacement. This includes a typical 2,000 sq ft composition shingle roof replacement in Houston ($8,000-15,000 for materials and labor) plus a permit ($150-300).
