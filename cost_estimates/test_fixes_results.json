STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS' mandates the assumption of a potential structural concern. Therefore, a licensed structural engineer evaluation is the critical first step. The low estimate ($1,150) includes a structural engineer evaluation ($800-1,500, using $800 for low end) and a roofer's assessment with minor spot repair (e.g., re-securing loose shingles, minor flashing repair: $300-500 for 2-3 hours labor @ $70-120/hr + materials). The high estimate ($9,800) includes a structural engineer evaluation ($1,500 for high end), a significant roof repair or partial replacement (e.g., 500-1000 sq ft section including decking and underlayment: $4,000-8,000 for materials and 3-5 days labor @ $70-120/hr), and potential minor structural reinforcement identified by the engineer ($1,000-3,000 for sistering rafters or minor truss repair), plus a permit ($300). This wide range reflects the high uncertainty due to the lack of specific issue details. The 'Structural Systems' category implies potential underlying issues like sagging trusses or compromised decking, which must be ruled out.",

The high estimate ($21,500) includes these evaluations ($1,500 + $600) plus a significant potential repair scenario: foundation repair (e.g., 8 piers @ $1,500/pier = $12,000), drainage improvements ($2,500), moderate mold remediation ($3,000), and cosmetic drywall/paint repairs ($1,500) after opening walls, plus permits ($200). This wide range reflects the high uncertainty of the underlying issue. Labor for repairs would vary significantly based on scope, but foundation specialists typically charge $90-140/hr, mold remediation specialists $70-120/hr, and general contractors $50-100/hr.

      "reasoning": "Confidence is very low due to the extremely vague and corrupted issue description. The low end ($100) covers a basic diagnostic service call by a TACL-certified HVAC technician (1-2 hours @ $85-150/hr) to identify the problem. The high end ($5,500) represents a potential major component replacement, such as a new furnace (if the natural gas system is failing, $2,500-5,000) or a new AC condenser ($2,500-5,500), including labor (10-20 hours @ $85-150/hr) and materials. This estimate does not include a full system replacement which could be significantly higher. A permit ($50-150) may be required for major component replacements.",
      "assumptions": [
        "The corrupted text refers to a general issue with the central HVAC system.",
        "The system includes both a central AC unit and a natural gas furnace.",
        "The issue is not a simple user error (e.g., thermostat off or circuit breaker tripped).",
        "The property has standard residential HVAC equipment.",
        "The estimate covers diagnosis and potential repair/replacement of a single major component."
      ],
      "risk_factors": [
        "The actual issue could be a complete system failure requiring full replacement ($5,000-$12,000).",
        "Hidden issues like ductwork problems, refrigerant leaks, or electrical faults could be present, increasing costs.",
        "Mold growth in the air handler or ductwork is common in Houston's humidity if the system has been malfunctioning.",
        "Peak season demand (summer) could increase costs and extend the timeline for repairs.",
        "If the system uses R-22 refrigerant, replacement is strongly recommended due to phase-out."
